This section contains hands-on security labs performed in my home SOC lab environment.

The purpose of these labs is to simulate real-world attack scenarios and practice:

- Log analysis
- Incident triage
- Threat detection
- Windows event investigation
- Phishing analysis
- Basic malware behavior observation

Each lab will include:
- Objective

This section demonstrates practical SOC analyst skills.
